							<p> It indeed is a great honour and privilege for me to lead one lakh strong state police force for serving 6.5 crore people of Karnataka. Karnataka State Police has been pioneer in leveraging technology at least a decade before rest of the country. Be it CCTNS,Cyber Crime Police Station, in house state of art Police Data Centre or Automated Fingerprints Identification System (AFIS); we have been the leaders.On the welfare front, Arogya Bhagya for the health of policemen and their families has been replicated by many other states. We are the pioneers in starting absolutely transparent and objective system for the recruitment of constabulary and Sub-Inspectors. The next step is to integrate CCTNS with the courts and prisons under the aegis of ICJS.</p>

							<p>
								  Look forward to your valuable cooperation in all our endeavours. </p>
